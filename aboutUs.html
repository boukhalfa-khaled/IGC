              The International General Certification Center is an institution
              registered in England and Wales under the number 15377750 to
              provide a certificate of competence in various fields to skilled
              people. We believe there are many talented and skilled individuals
              who lack formal recognition and opportunities to showcase their
              skills. Our platform seeks to bridge this gap by offering a
              rigorous testing process that assesses individuals’ skills and
              knowledge in their respective fields. Once a person passes the
              test, they receive a certificate that recognizes their competence
              and opens up new opportunities for them. Our platform is based on
              the principles of fairness, transparency and inclusiveness. We
              believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity to prove
              their skills and gain recognition for their work. We have designed
              our testing process to be free of bias and discrimination, and
              ensure that every candidate is treated with respect and dignity.
